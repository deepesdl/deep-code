`deep-code` is a lightweight python tool that comprises a command line interface(CLI) 
and Python API providing utilities that aid integration of DeepESDL datasets, 
experiments with EarthCODE.

The first release will focus on implementing the publish feature of DeepESDL 
experiments/workflow as OGC API record and Datasets as an OSC stac collection.

## Setup

## Install
`deep-code` will be available in PyPI and conda-forge. Till the stable release,
developers/contributors can follow the below steps to install deep-code.

## Installing from the repository for Developers/Contributors

To install deep-code directly from the git repository, clone the repository, and execute the steps below:

```commandline
conda env create
conda activate deep-code
pip install -e .
```

This installs all the dependencies of `deep-code` into a fresh conda environment, 
and installs deep-code from the repository into the same environment.

## Testing

To run the unit test suite:

```commandline
pytest
```

To analyze test coverage
```shell
pytest --cov=deep-code
```

To produce an HTML coverage report

```commandline
pytest --cov-report html --cov=deep-code
```

## deep_code usage

`deep_code` provides a command-line tool called deep-code, which has several subcommands 
providing different utility functions.
Use the --help option with these subcommands to get more details on usage.

The CLI retrieves the Git username and personal access token from a hidden file named 
.gitaccess. Ensure this file is located in the same directory where you execute the CLI
command.

#### .gitaccess example

```
github-username: your-git-user
github-token: personal access token
```

###  deep-code publish

Publish the experiment, workflow and dataset which is a result of an experiment to 
the EarthCODE open-science catalog.

```commandline
 deep-code publish /path/to/dataset-config.yaml /path/to/workflow-config.yaml
 ```

#### dataset-config.yaml example

```
dataset_id: esa-cci-permafrost-1x1151x1641-1.0.0.zarr
collection_id: esa-cci-permafrost
osc_themes:
  - cryosphere
osc_region: global
# non-mandatory
documentation_link: https://deepesdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datasets/esa-cci-permafrost-1x1151x1641-0-0-2-zarr
access_link: s3://deep-esdl-public/esa-cci-permafrost-1x1151x1641-1.0.0.zarr
dataset_status: completed
```

dataset-id has to be a valid dataset-id from `deep-esdl-public` s3 bucket or your team 
bucket.

#### workflow-config.yaml example

```
workflow_id: "esa-cci-permafrost"
